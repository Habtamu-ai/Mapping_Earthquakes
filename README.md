# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Overview
The main purpose of this project is to create earthquake map with three different map and the earthquake overlay. The map creates the earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates', where the earthquake located on earth , and earthquake that are morethan 4.5 in magnitude.
# Results
The image below shows tha map that conatins
 - The tectonic Plate Data is added to the layer group, the tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object, the tectonic plate data is added to the map, the fault lines are styled, and finally, the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed when the page loads.
 - The major earthquake data is added as a third layer group, the tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object, the major earthquake data is added to the map and styled the major earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed when the page loads
 - The third map that dark is added to the overlay object, aLL the earthquake data, and tectonic plate data are displayed on all maps on the webpage.

# Summary
The main purpose of this project is to create an earthquake map with three different maps and an earthquake overlay. The above analysis clearly shows the map has three maps (such as satellite, streets, and dark). It also shows where the earthquake is in the earth their relation with the tectonic plate, and finally, it shows the major earthquakes based on their magnitude.
